# Hello-World
This repository acts as my first repository as a developer. Cheers to learning! 

I'm taking a data science course, and learning the fundamentals of Git & GitHub. I want to collaborate on projects that make a positive impact on the world. 
** Practicing making changes to a file -- woohoo!
